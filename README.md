# Other
I am in no way appropriating royale brawl for myself or anyone else, this repo is considered a fork of the main royale brawl repo. I made this shit because I had nothing to do, so don't pay attention to bugs and so on because this server is not for prod!
and I am NOT helping to run this shit in my socials , do it all by yourself (basic help above in the text) I am burned out from SC(not re)
